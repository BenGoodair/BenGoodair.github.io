Interpretation: We conduct a review of the scientific evidence and find that healthcare privatisation often corresponds with worse quality care. For example, staffing ratios often decline after a hospital is privatised. The rate of patient infections also tend to increase – possibly due to fewer cleaning staff per patient. And the aggregate effect is that increased privatisation can end up corresponding with more patients dying from avoidable causes – as was evidenced in England between 2013 and 2020.
