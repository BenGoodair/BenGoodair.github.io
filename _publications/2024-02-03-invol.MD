Interpretation: The proportion of care home closures due to CQC enforcements, relative to all closures, is increasing. Since 2011, 816 care homes (representing 19â€‰918 registered beds) have been involuntarily closed by the CQC. Our results show that effectively all involuntary closures (804/816) occurred in for-profit care homes. This data emphasises the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impact of for-profit provision on the quality and sustainability of adult social care in England.
