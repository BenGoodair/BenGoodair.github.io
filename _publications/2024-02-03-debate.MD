Interpretation: We make our case against outsourcing healthcare services to the private sector in this debate article.

We suggest two pathways:

1 - The profit-motive: 'private sector incentives are actually antithetical to providing high quality care'

2 - System-wide effects: 'mixed-markets have “knock-on effects” on the ability for state-owned providers to deliver healthcare.'
