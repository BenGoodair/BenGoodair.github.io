Interpretation: We assess the relationship between public funding levels and NHS outsourcing. We conclude: NHS privatisation at the local level does not appear to be a direct response to or result of austerity. That does not mean that it is unproblematic. Rather than being confounded by funding levels, the deteriorating health outcomes associated with privatisation should be considered as a distinct concern to the disastrous health effects of austerity policies.
