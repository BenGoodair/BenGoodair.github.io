Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a community-driven social researcher looking at the impacts of privatisation.

I research how health systems, social care services, and social policy affect population health. I have specific expertise in privatisation of health and social care services.

I teach on multiple courses in the areas of social policy, quantitative methods and policy evaluation.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford currently working on measuring the impacts of social care outsourcing in England.

My research interests are:

* Privatisation of public services
* Health and social care policy
* Health systems
* Social policy 
* Evaluation methods

On this website you can find my CV, publications and presentations.
